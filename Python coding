Define a Python class Vehicle with an instance variable name and a method start which prints a message. Then define two subclasses Car and Bicyles that override the start method to print "vroom!" and "pedal!" respectively....

class Vehicle:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
    
    def start(self):
        print(self.name + " is starting")

class Car(Vehicle):
    def start(self):
        print(self.name + " is starting with a vroom!")

class Bicycle(Vehicle):
    def start(self):
        print(self.name + " is ready to pedal!")

# Example usage
vehicle = Vehicle("Generic Vehicle")
car = Car("Toyota Camry")
bicycle = Bicycle("Mountain Bike")

vehicle.start()
car.start()
bicycle.start()
